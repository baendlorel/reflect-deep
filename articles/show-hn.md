# Show HN: ReflectDeep - A powerful TypeScript library for deep object manipulation

Hey everyone! üëã

I've been working on a TypeScript library called **ReflectDeep** that makes deep object manipulation much easier and safer. After dealing with countless nested property access bugs and circular reference nightmares in various projects, I decided to build something robust and developer-friendly.

## What is ReflectDeep?

ReflectDeep is a comprehensive utility library for deep reflection operations on JavaScript objects. Think of it as a supercharged version of native `Reflect` methods, but for nested properties with a lot of extra safety features.

## Key Features

üîç **Deep Property Access** - Classic APIs like `get`, `set`, `has`, `deleteProperty`, and `defineProperty` but for nested paths
üîÑ **Bulletproof Deep Cloning** - Handles circular references, Maps, Sets, TypedArrays, and more
üîë **Prototype Chain Inspection** - Extract keys from entire prototype chains with `keys()` and `groupedKeys()`
üõ°Ô∏è **Full TypeScript Support** - Proper type inference and safety
üåê **Comprehensive Type Coverage** - Works with Arrays, Maps, Sets, Dates, RegExp, Node.js Buffers, etc.

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { ReflectDeep } from 'reflect-deep';

const obj = { users: [{ profile: { settings: { theme: 'dark' } } }] };

// Safe nested access
const theme = ReflectDeep.get(obj, ['users', 0, 'profile', 'settings', 'theme']);
// Returns 'dark' or undefined if path doesn't exist

// Safe nested assignment with auto-creation
ReflectDeep.set(obj, ['users', 0, 'profile', 'notifications'], { email: true });

// Check if nested property exists
const hasTheme = ReflectDeep.has(obj, ['users', 0, 'profile', 'settings', 'theme']);

// Clone with circular reference support
const cloned = ReflectDeep.clone(obj);
```

## What Makes It Different?

**Safety First**: No more `Cannot read property of undefined` errors when accessing nested properties.

**Circular Reference Handling**: Unlike `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())`, this actually handles circular references properly.

**Familiar API**: If you know `Reflect.get()`, you already know `ReflectDeep.get()` - just pass an array of keys instead.

**TypeScript Native**: Built from the ground up with TypeScript, with proper type inference.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Configuration Management**: Safely access nested config objects
- **Form Validation**: Navigate complex form data structures
- **API Response Processing**: Handle deeply nested API responses
- **State Management**: Clone and manipulate complex application state
- **Object Transformation**: Transform nested data structures without mutation

## Performance & Compatibility

- Uses `WeakMap` for efficient circular reference detection
- No external dependencies
- Works in Node.js and browsers
- Handles edge cases like TypedArrays, DataView, Node.js Buffers
- Optimized for different object types

The library is MIT licensed and has comprehensive test coverage. I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

## Questions I'm Curious About

1. What's your current approach to handling nested object operations?
2. Have you run into circular reference issues with cloning?
3. Would you find the prototype chain inspection features useful?

Thanks for checking it out! üöÄ
